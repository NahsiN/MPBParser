# MPBParser
This is my attempt at parsing the data output from the [MIT Photonics-Bands](http://ab-initio.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/MIT_Photonic_Bands)
(MPB) package into a more friendly form. Internally, our group uses an aging but
stable package called MPB Utilities written by Mark Patterson, an alumni gifted
with an excellent coding ability.
They say imitation is the most sincere form of flattery and given Matlab's licensing
restrictions and the restructuing of IT services here at Queen's University,
I have decided to create my own set of utlilities to analyze and plot data
from MPB in Python. An early goal is to emulate
Patterson's MPBBandstructure class while addressing some of it's shortcomings.
But first and foremost, this project has been selfishly created for me
to aid my ongoing transition from Matlab to Python. Adding proper documentation
is on the table but with no guaranteed timeline till I can see the light at the
end of the PhD tunnel. Stay tuned!

Please note this is one of the many attempts at making sense of MPB's data output.
See [pyMPB](http://www.ece.ubc.ca/~hessamm/pympb.html) or
[mpb-plotting](https://github.com/FilipDominec/mpb-plotting) for more details.
