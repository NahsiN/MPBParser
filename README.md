# MPBParser
This is my attempt at parsing the data output from the MIT Photonics Bands
Package (MPB) into a more friendly form. Internally, our group uses an aging but
stable package called MPB Utilities written by Mark Patterson, an alumni.
They say imitation is the most sincere form of flattery and given Matlab's licensing
restrictions and the restructuing of IT services at Queen's University,
I have decided to create my own set of utlilities to analyze and plot data
from MPB in Python. An early goal is to emulate
Patterson's MPBBandstructure class while addressing some of it's shortcomings.
But first and foremost, this project has been created by me to aid my ongoing
transition from Matlab to Python. Adding proper documentation is on the table
but with no guaranteed timeline till I can see the light at the end of the PhD
tunnel. Stay tuned!
