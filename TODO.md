## Numerical things
- [ ] **High** do an integral
- [ ] **Med** strip phase from EM fields if needed
- [ ] **Low** plot the bands, fields, epsilon
- [ ] **Low** tree structure for mpb geomteric objects
- [ ] **Low** get Îµ for slab and air using tree structure

## Error Checks
- [ ] **Low** in readfield error for invalid field_type

## Completed
- [x] MPBBandstructure class to load all the band data from mpb output
- [x] readfield function to read fields from mpb output
- [x] **High** indicator function for slab only, slab-hole boundary only
- [x] **Med** base class for tensor types having the close() function in common
